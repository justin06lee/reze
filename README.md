# Reze

A macOS menu-bar app that turns short triggers into full prompts.

Hit a global hotkey anywhere, type `full analysis`, press Enter — the paragraph
you actually meant gets pasted into whatever app you were already in.

```

```

## Using it

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `⌘⇧Space` | Open the palette over the current app (configurable) |
| `↑` `↓` / `⌃N` `⌃P` | Move through results |
| `↵` | Expand and paste — or open the fill-in step if the macro has variables |
| `⌘↵` | Put the expansion on the clipboard instead of pasting |
| `esc` | Back out of fill-in, or close |

The tray icon opens the macro editor, where you can add, edit, tag, duplicate
and delete macros, rebind the hotkey, and change how expansions are delivered.

## Template syntax

Deliberately tiny — anything more expressive belongs in the prompt itself.

| Syntax | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{{target}}` | A variable. The palette prompts you for it before pasting. |
| `{{target\|this codebase}}` | Same, pre-filled with a default. |
| `{{> rigor}}` | Inline another macro by its trigger, so shared preamble lives in one place. |
| `{{clipboard}}` | Whatever you last copied. |
| `{{date}}` `{{time}}` `{{datetime}}` | Filled automatically, never prompted. |

Includes nest, and a macro that (transitively) includes itself is reported in
the editor rather than recursing forever.

## Storage

Everything lives in `~/.reze/macros.json`, and **that file is the source of
truth** — the GUI is a convenience layer over it. Edit it in any text editor and
Reze picks up the change immediately; edit it in the app and your editor sees
the change on next read. Diff it, commit it, sync it however you like.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "settings": {
    "hotkey": "CmdOrCtrl+Shift+Space",
    "pasteMode": "paste",        // or "copy" to never paste directly
    "restoreClipboard": true
  },
  "macros": [
    {
      "id": "…",
      "name": "full analysis",
      "description": "Deep end-to-end read of a codebase",
      "tags": ["review"],
      "body": "{{> rigor}}\n\nFully and thoroughly analyze {{target|this codebase}}…",
      "usageCount": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Accessibility permission

macOS has no supported way to inject text into another app, so pasting works by
putting the expansion on the clipboard and synthesizing `⌘V`. That needs
**Accessibility** permission, and without it the keystroke is silently swallowed
— the palette opens, and nothing arrives.

The editor shows a banner with a button that jumps straight to
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility when the permission is
missing. Your previous clipboard contents are restored a moment after the paste
lands (turn that off in Settings if you'd rather they weren't).

Note that the permission is granted per-binary: the dev build and a bundled
`Reze.app` are separate entries, and each needs granting once.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run tauri dev      # run it
bun run tauri build    # produce Reze.app + a .dmg in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

- `src-tauri/src/store.rs` — the JSON library, its schema, and the seed macros
- `src-tauri/src/paste.rs` — clipboard + synthesized keystroke, and the permission check
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — windows, tray, global hotkey, file watcher, IPC commands
- `src/lib/template.ts` — the template language (variables, includes, built-ins)
- `src/lib/fuzzy.ts` — the palette's ranking
- `src/Palette.tsx`, `src/Editor.tsx` — the two windows, routed by window label

Both windows load the same bundle; `main.tsx` picks a component from
`getCurrentWindow().label`.
